## Other stuff

#### Personalize page content in `/src/portfolio.js` & modify it as per your need. You will also need to modify `index.html` to change the title and metadata to provide accurate SEO for your personal portfolio.

```javascript
/* Change this file to get your Personal Porfolio */

const greeting = {
  /* Your Summary And Greeting Section */
  title: "Hi all I'm Saad",
  subTitle: emoji("A passionate Full Stack Software Developer 🚀"),
  resumeLink: "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ofFdKF_mqscH8WvXkSObnVvC9kK7Ldlu/view?usp=sharing"
};

const socialMediaLinks = {
  /* Your Social Media Link */
  github: "https://github.com/saadpasta",
  linkedin: "https://www.linkedin.com/in/saadpasta/",
  gmail: "saadpasta70@gmail.com",

## My Skills
When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on GitHub Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.
